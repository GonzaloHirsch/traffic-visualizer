[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is one of the **serverless computing services from the Google Cloud Platform**. In it, you **run Docker container images** that are purpose-built for your application.

No solutions by Google Cloud allow you to visualize traffic in real time, breaking it down for you.
